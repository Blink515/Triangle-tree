Download the Blynk app on your phone or tablet. 

Scan the QR code in the file list to generate the project in the Blynk app.  I am not sure how much energy is required for the app since I am using a local server with unlimited amounts of energy.

Get the auth code that is generated by the Blynk app for the project and add it to the .ino file on line 48

Edit line 57 with your wifi ssid, password and local server IP address if using a local server

Edit line 58 with your wifi ssid and password if using Blynk Cloud.

Upload the code to your board, press the play button in the Blynk app and then you should be all set.
